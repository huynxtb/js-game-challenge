Celestial Cartographer - Console Game Welcome!

Introduction:
You are the Celestial Cartographer, an interstellar mapmaker assigned the mission to explore and document 50 star systems in a procedurally generated universe. Your goal is to map these star systems with high accuracy and completeness while managing your spaceship's limited resources: Fuel, Time, and Research Points.

Game Objective:
Explore star systems by scanning sectors of space. Each scan consumes resources depending on depth and research investment. Your objective is to achieve at least 80% map completion and 90% average accuracy before running out of Fuel or Time.

Core Mechanics:
- Each turn, choose a scan depth (Shallow, Medium, Deep) which affects resource consumption and the number of star systems discovered.
- Invest Research Points to improve the accuracy of your star system scan results.
- Manage your Fuel, Time, and Research Points carefully to optimize your exploration.
- When you scan a star system, you will learn its details and gain additional research points based on data richness.

Winning Conditions:
- Map at least 80% of the star systems (at least 40 systems out of 50)
- Achieve an average mapping accuracy of at least 90% across scanned star systems
- Complete this before running out of Fuel or Time resources.
