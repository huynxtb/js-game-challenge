Chrono Cartographer

Game Introduction:
Chrono Cartographer is a text-based, turn-based console game where you play as a time-traveling explorer tasked with mapping uncharted eras in human history. Your mission is to strategically jump through various crucial time periods, document historically significant events, and accumulate Knowledge Points. Managing your limited resource, Chrono Fuel, wisely is essential to success.

Setup Instructions:
1. Ensure you have Node.js installed on your system (https://nodejs.org/).
2. Save the provided JavaScript code into a file named 'chrono_cartographer.js'.

How to Run the Game:
1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where 'chrono_cartographer.js' is saved.
3. Run the game with the command: node chrono_cartographer.js

Gameplay Instructions:
- You have 20 turns (time jumps) and a starting Chrono Fuel amount of 50.
- Each turn, you'll choose a historical era to visit from the provided list.
- Each era costs Chrono Fuel to jump to; more challenging periods cost more fuel but offer higher potential Knowledge Points.
- Upon visiting, you'll attempt to document events; success depends on your current Knowledge Points versus the era's difficulty.
- Successfully documenting grants Knowledge Points, bringing you closer to your target of 100 Knowledge Points.
- Special abilities unlock as you gain Knowledge Points, aiding your journey:
   * Fuel Saver: reduces the fuel cost of each jump by 1 (minimum cost 1).
   * Knowledge Booster: increases Knowledge Points gained from successful events by 20%.
- Be cautious—running out of Chrono Fuel ends the mission in failure.
- The game ends successfully if you reach or exceed 100 Knowledge Points within 20 jumps.

Enjoy your journey through time as the Chrono Cartographer! Good luck!
