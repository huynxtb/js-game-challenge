Chrono Crafters

Introduction:
Welcome to Chrono Crafters! You are the master of time, tasked with managing temporal resources to build and maintain a stable timeline before it collapses into chaotic paradoxes.

Game Objective:
Craft a total of 10 Chrono Artifacts by managing and allocating three temporal resources (Moments, Eras, Events) each turn while dealing with random temporal anomalies. Keep the timeline stable and prevent it from collapsing.

Core Mechanics:
- Turn-based game where each turn is a 'Tick' of time.
- Manage resources: Moments, Eras, Events.
- Craft Time Artifacts that increase timeline stability.
- Temporal anomalies randomly occur; you must repair them before they reduce stability too much.
- Balance resource generation, crafting artifacts, and anomaly repair strategically.

Win Condition:
Craft 10 Chrono Artifacts to stabilize the timeline before it collapses.

Loss Condition:
Timeline stability drops to zero or resources are depleted making it impossible to act.

How To Play:
- Each turn you will see the status of your resources, timeline stability, and any active anomaly.
- Choose an action:
  1. Craft a Time Artifact by consuming resources.
  2. Repair a Temporal Anomaly if present and if you have enough resources.
  3. Do nothing / Wait.
- Each turn resources regenerate randomly.
- If anomalies are unresolved, they damage timeline stability each turn.

Setup & Running Instructions:
1. Ensure you have Node.js installed on your system.
2. Save the provided code in a file named chrono_crafters.js.
3. Open a terminal/command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the file.
4. Run the game with the command: node chrono_crafters.js
