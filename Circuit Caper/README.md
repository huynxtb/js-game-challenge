Circuit Caper - Console Game

Introduction:
You play as an AI engineer trapped inside a malfunctioning supercomputer. Your goal is to reroute power through a network of circuit nodes to restore the core system. Each node affects your limited power units differently, and you must activate nodes strategically to maintain power flow without triggering system failures.

Setup Instructions:
- Ensure you have Node.js installed on your system (https://nodejs.org).
- Save the provided code in a single file named circuit_caper.js.

How to Run the Game:
- Open your terminal or command prompt.
- Navigate to the directory where circuit_caper.js is saved.
- Run the game using the command:

  node circuit_caper.js

Gameplay:
- The game runs fully in the console.
- Each turn, you will see the current power units, activated nodes, and nodes available to activate next.
- Nodes can increase or decrease your power units, or trigger system events.
- Activate nodes connected to your current path to extend it.
- Manage your power units so they never drop to zero or below.
- The game ends if you successfully activate the Core Node (C) or if you run out of power or hit a critical system failure.

Controls:
- Enter the ID of the node you wish to activate when prompted.
- Invalid or unavailable nodes cannot be chosen.

Enjoy the challenge of Circuit Caper and restore the supercomputer's core system!
