Galactic Relay - Console Space Delivery Game

Introduction:
"Galactic Relay" is a turn-based strategy and resource management game played entirely in the console. You command an interstellar courier ship tasked with delivering critical packages to a chain of planets in a dangerous galaxy filled with hazards and enemy encounters.

Objective:
Successfully complete all delivery missions by navigating through space sectors while managing your limited fuel, ship integrity, and supplies such as repair kits. Survive space hazards including asteroid fields, pirate attacks, and system malfunctions.

Setup:
- Requires Node.js installed on your system.
- No external dependencies required.

How to Run:
1. Save the game code to a file named "galactic_relay.js".
2. Open your terminal/command prompt in the directory containing the file.
3. Run the command:

   node galactic_relay.js

Gameplay Instructions:
- Each turn, you will see your current status and options.
- Choose one action per turn:
  1. Move to the next planet (consumes fuel).
  2. Repair your ship using a repair kit.
  3. Attempt to refuel your ship (risky, may trigger pirate attacks).

- Random events may occur during travel, requiring you to make strategic decisions balancing risk and resource management.
