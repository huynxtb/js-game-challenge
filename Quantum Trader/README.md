Quantum Trader
================

Welcome to Quantum Trader! In this game, you play as a quantum-era merchant navigating a volatile multi-dimensional market. Your objective is to accumulate a net worth of $50,000 within 20 trading cycles by buying and selling exotic quantum commodities.

Game Objective:
- Achieve a net worth (capital + inventory value) of $50,000 or more within 20 trading cycles.
- Avoid running out of capital and inventory, or you lose.

Core Gameplay:
- Turn-based trading: Each cycle represents a trading period.
- Manage your capital and inventory of three quantum commodities:
  1. Quantum Flux (High risk, high volatility)
  2. Entanglinium (Medium risk, moderate volatility)
  3. Zero-Point Crystal (Low risk, low volatility)
- Prices fluctuate dynamically each cycle due to pseudo-random quantum market events, sometimes highly volatile.
- Each turn, decide whether to buy, sell, or hold commodities.
- Balance risk and reward to maximize profits.

Setup & Running the Game:
1. Ensure you have Node.js installed on your computer.
2. Save the game code into a file named quantum_trader.js.
3. Open your terminal/console and navigate to the file directory.
4. Run the game with the command:

Gameplay Tips:
- Monitor market prices closely each cycle.
- Buy low and sell high to profit.
