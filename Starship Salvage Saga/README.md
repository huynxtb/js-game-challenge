Starship Salvage Saga - Text-Based Console Space Salvage Adventure

Introduction:
You are the captain of a lone salvage starship drifting through a sector filled with derelict ships and mysterious debris. Your mission is to collect valuable salvage while managing your ship's resources: fuel, hull integrity, cargo space, and crew morale.

The game is turn-based. Each turn, you choose actions like traveling to new sectors, attempting salvage, repairing your ship, resting your crew, or viewing your current status.

Your goal is to accumulate at least 1000 credits from salvage and safely return to your home base located in sector 0. Beware of hazards such as asteroid fields, radiation zones, and encounters with space pirates. Running out of fuel, hull integrity dropping to zero, or crew morale falling to zero ends the game in failure.
