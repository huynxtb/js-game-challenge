Stellar Salvage is a text-based console game built for Node.js where you command a salvage ship exploring derelict star systems to collect valuable artifacts and resources while managing your ship's limited fuel and integrity.

Objective:
Accumulate at least 1000 credits worth of cargo and safely return to your home base.

Gameplay:
- Each turn, choose an action: explore new sector, attempt to salvage artifacts, repair your ship, or return to base.
- Exploring consumes fuel and generates random events like salvage opportunities, hazards that damage your ship, repair opportunities, or empty sectors.
- Salvaging depends on your ship's condition and consumes cargo space.
- Repairing uses some cargo space but restores ship integrity.
- Returning to base ends your run and evaluates your success.

Setup & Running:
- Ensure you have Node.js installed (https://nodejs.org).
- Save the game code in a file named "stellar_salvage.js".
- Run the game in your terminal with the command:
  node stellar_salvage.js

Enjoy the challenge of balancing risk and resource management in the vastness of space as you seek to become the ultimate Stellar Salvager!
